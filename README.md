### Features

- Hide in Containers
  - Great for resource packs with transparent backgrounds and buttons. For example, on my pack, having the crosshair on in the pause menu turns "done" into "dope".
- Show in Third Person
  - Shows the crosshair while in third person. It still sits in the middle of your head, however.
- Remove Blending
  - Removes the color blending applied to the crosshair. This means the crosshair will always be white. When looking at certain blocks it may make the crosshair hard to see, but looks cool otherwise.
